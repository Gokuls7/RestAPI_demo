## Steps for creating a basic chart web application using React.js

### Step 1: Check for dependencies

Make sure you have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 installed on your machine.

### Step 2: Creating first react-app

```
npx create-react-app reactplotting
cd reactplotting
npm start
```

npm is a package manager, likewise we have yarn. Both have their own advantages. Yarn is faster than npm. Its based on user to select a package manager.

### Step 3: Include chart models in React

```
npm install --save react-Chart.js-2 chart.js
```

react-Chart.js-2  -> wrapper for chart.js

### Step 4: Add Dummy data 

To visualize any kind of chart, we need data. Hence, create a dummy file named Data.js. Add the required data for plotting Graphs.

### Step 5: Charts

Add various chart form in components directory and include them in the App.js file.

### Step 6: Run 

```
npm install
npm start
```
